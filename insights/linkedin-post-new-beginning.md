# LinkedIn Post: A New Beginning, A Familiar Memory

## Post Text

Starting Monday, I'm joining Valiantys, and my welcome pack arrived this week with something unexpected: a small pot of mint seeds.

Most people would see a simple gift. For me, it connected to a memory I carry everywhere.

Mint reminds me of Will—a close friend I lost years ago. He was sharp, grumpy in the best way, and obsessed with plants. His dream was to work at Kew Gardens. After he passed, I found a bench there dedicated to him. Every year, I return, sit quietly, and mark another year since he left.

There's also a playlist called "Mint"—tracks we shared, argued about, played too loud. Music holds memory like nothing else.

And there's a music video by Candy Apple Blue, "Not A Day Goes By," where I submitted Will's photo to be included in their tribute to lost loved ones. He's there, frozen in time, part of something larger.

When those mint seeds arrived, it felt like a quiet nudge. Not mystical—just a reminder that you carry your past into every next step. Your people, your influences, your stories don't disappear. They walk with you.

I'm joining Valiantys because it aligns with how I want to work: structured, technical, focused. After years building LT.Solutions and navigating complex technical environments, this feels like the right move at the right time.

And somehow, these mint seeds have made it feel personal too.

Will would have grilled me about whether this job was actually the right fit, asked sharp questions, then grudgingly admitted it sounded decent. That's how we worked.

So I'm taking this as a reminder: you carry your past, your people, and your standards into every new chapter. Sometimes life nods back and says, "Yes, keep going."

This is the beginning of something new. And it already feels familiar.

Here's to new beginnings that honour old friendships. Here's to mint seeds and memory. Here's to carrying the people who shaped us into chapters they'll never see.

Will would have told me to stop being sentimental and just water the damn plant.

So that's what I'll do.

## Alternative Shorter Version (if the full version feels too long)

Starting Monday at Valiantys. My welcome pack included mint seeds—a small gift that hit harder than expected.

Mint reminds me of Will, a close friend I lost years ago. He loved plants, dreamed of working at Kew Gardens, and grew mint everywhere. I visit his memorial bench there every year.

When those seeds arrived, it felt like a reminder: you carry your past into every next step. Your people, your influences, your stories walk with you.

This new role feels right—structured, technical, aligned with how I want to work. And somehow, these mint seeds made it personal.

Will would have told me to stop being sentimental and just water the plant. So that's what I'll do.

Here's to new beginnings that honour old friendships. 🌱
