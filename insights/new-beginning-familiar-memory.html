      Starting a new job is usually a practical moment—new laptop, new logins, new team. But every now and then, life hands you something that feels a bit more symbolic, something that taps you on the shoulder and says: this chapter isn't just beginning, it's connecting.

      <p class="text-lg">
        This week, I received a welcome pack from the organisation I'm joining on Monday. Among the usual bits—branded notebook, company swag, the standard "we're excited to have you" letter—there was a small plant pot with a packet of mint seeds.
      </p>

      <p class="text-lg">
        A simple gift, nothing dramatic. The kind of thing most people would smile at, set on a windowsill, and probably forget to water. But for me, it landed in a place I didn't expect.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- The Memory Section -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>The Friend Who Loved Plants</h2>

      <p>
        Mint has always been tied to the memory of someone I lost many years ago. His name was Will. A close friend, the kind of friend you only get once in a lifetime if you're lucky.
      </p>

      <p>
        Will was clever, sharp-witted, grumpy in that endearing way that made you work harder to earn his smile. He was the person you'd call when you needed someone to tell you the truth, not what you wanted to hear. And he was completely, utterly obsessed with plants.
      </p>

      <p>
        His dream was to work at Kew Gardens. Not just visit, not just volunteer—he wanted to be there among the greenhouses and botanical collections, surrounded by the living things he understood better than most people. He'd talk for hours about soil composition, Latin plant names, the perfect growing conditions for herbs that most of us only knew as pizza toppings.
      </p>

      <p>
        Mint was his thing. He grew it everywhere—in pots, in gardens, in spaces you wouldn't think could sustain anything green. He'd harvest it, dry it, make tea from it, give bundles of it away like some kind of herbal evangelist. The smell of fresh mint still brings him back, instantly and vividly.
      </p>

      <figure class="article-image">
        <img src="../images/will-kew-bench.jpg" alt="Memorial bench for Will at Kew Gardens" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>Will's bench at Kew Gardens—a place I return to every year</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        After he passed, I found a bench there dedicated to him. It's tucked away in a quiet corner, surrounded by the greenery he loved. Every year, I go. I sit. I have a quiet moment. I mark another year since he left.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's become a ritual, not out of obligation, but because it feels necessary. A way to honour someone who meant something, who shaped how I think, who challenged me to be better, sharper, more honest.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- The Playlist Section -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>Music Remembers for Us</h2>

      <p>
        There's also a playlist called "Mint". A collection of tracks we shared, argued about, laughed at, and played far too loudly in cars, bedrooms, badly lit pubs. Music has this peculiar ability to hold memory in a way nothing else can.
      </p>

      <p>
        You hear a song and suddenly you're back there—same conversation, same stupid joke, same feeling of being understood by someone who saw through your nonsense. The playlist isn't sacred or untouchable. It just exists, quietly, a reminder that some friendships transcend timelines.
      </p>

      <div class="callout-box callout-box--info">
        <h4>Candy Apple Blue – Not A Day Goes By</h4>
        <p>
          Another part of that memory is linked to a band called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iaw_ABJzgaE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Candy Apple Blue</a>. They once invited their fans to submit photos of loved ones they had lost, to be included in a music video for <em>Not A Day Goes By</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I sent in a picture of Will, and it became part of something larger—a small but meaningful tribute inside a piece of art that reaches people all over the world. Every time I watch that video, I see him there, frozen in a moment, part of a collective remembrance for people who mattered.

    <!-- The Coincidence Section -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>When the Past Meets the Future</h2>

      <p>
        So when this small pot of mint seeds showed up in my new-job welcome pack, it felt like a quiet nudge. A reminder that even when life moves forward—and it does, relentlessly—some memories walk with you.
      </p>

      <figure class="article-image">
        <img src="../images/mint-seed-pot.jpg" alt="Small pot of mint seeds from welcome pack" loading="lazy">
        <figcaption>The unexpected gift that connected past and future</figcaption>
      </figure>

      <p>
        I'm not someone who leans heavily into signs or cosmic meanings. I don't think the universe orchestrates these things deliberately. But I do think we notice patterns when we're ready to see them, when something aligns in a way that feels meaningful.
      </p>

      <p>
        All of these threads—the mint, the bench, the playlist, the music video, and now this unexpected pot in a welcome pack—feel like they've tied themselves into the start of this new chapter.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- The New Chapter Section -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>Starting Something Right</h2>

      <p>
        I'm about to join a new team and step into work that aligns with how I want to operate. More structured, more technical, and more in tune with what I'm good at. It feels like the right move at the right time.
      </p>

      <p>
        After years of navigating complex technical environments, after building LT.Solutions into something I'm proud of, after the chaos of crypto tax nightmares and late-night troubleshooting sessions, this feels like a deliberate step toward clarity and focus.
      </p>

      <p>
        And this little coincidence with the mint seeds has made it feel strangely personal too. Not in a mystical, fate-driven way, but in the sense that you carry your past with you—your people, your influences, your stories—into every next step.
      </p>

      <blockquote>
        <p>
          You don't leave your friends behind when they're gone. You carry them forward, in the choices you make, the standards you hold, the moments you pause to remember.
        </p>
      </blockquote>

      <p>
        Will would have liked this job, I think. He'd have asked sharp questions about what I'd actually be doing, challenged me on whether it was genuinely the right fit, then grudgingly admitted it sounded decent. That's how we worked.
      </p>

      <p>
        So I'm taking the mint seeds as a sign of sorts—not the mystical type, more a reminder that you carry your past, your people, your influences, and your stories into every next step. And sometimes, life nods back and says: yes, keep going.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- Closing Section -->
    <section class="article-section">
      <h2>This Is the Beginning</h2>

      <p>
        This is the beginning of something new. And somehow, it already feels familiar.
      </p>

      <p>
        The mint will grow. The memories will stay. The work will be challenging and rewarding in ways I haven't fully mapped out yet. And somewhere in all of that, there's a thread connecting where I've been to where I'm going.
      </p>

      <p class="font-weight-semibold">
        Here's to new beginnings that honour old friendships. Here's to mint seeds and memory. Here's to carrying the people who shaped us into the chapters they'll never see.
      </p>

      <p>
        Will would have told me to stop being sentimental and just water the damn plant. So that's what I'll do.
      </p>
