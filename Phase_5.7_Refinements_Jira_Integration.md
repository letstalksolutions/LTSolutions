# LT.Solutions â€“ Phase 5.7 Refinements & Jira Integration

This repository supports **Phase 5.7** of the LT.Solutions site build.  
The focus of this phase is twofold: refining front-end consistency and establishing Jira integration for issue tracking and automation.

---

## ðŸ§­ Overview

Phase 5.7 bridges design polish with structured integration.  
Every refinement is tracked as a Jira issue under the project key **LS-[number]**, e.g. `LS-1201`.

This ensures all visual, functional, and integration updates are traceable within the same delivery framework.
