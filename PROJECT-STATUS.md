### 4. Brand Separator Evolution ✅
**Status:** COMPLETE - Three Iterations to Perfection

**Royal Blue Color Introduction:**
- Identified Tyrian Blue/Royal Blue: `#4169E1` (rgb 65, 105, 225)
- Ancient precious dye color from murex sea snails (historical significance)
- Added as accent color alongside brand red `#CE0000`
- Creates sophisticated three-color brand system (Red, Blue, White)

**Enhanced SVG Node Network Design:**
- 7 strategically positioned nodes across 1920px canvas
- 6 connection lines between nodes
- Color scheme:
  - Red nodes: `rgba(206, 0, 0, 0.7)`
  - Royal Blue nodes: `rgba(65, 105, 225, 0.7)`
  - White accent centers: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)`
  - Connection lines: varying opacity (0.12-0.2)
- Pulsing ring animations on each node (8s cycle, staggered)

**Animation Evolution - Problem Solving:**

*Iteration 1:* Individual node translate animations
- **Issue:** Nodes disconnected from line endpoints during movement
- **User Feedback:** "dots are not connected to the actual string"

*Iteration 2:* Scale-only animations on nodes
- **Issue:** Still showed visible disconnection during animation
- **User Feedback:** Screenshot showing continued disconnection

*Iteration 3 (FINAL):* Organism Animation Pattern ✅
- **Key Innovation:** Animate entire SVG container instead of individual nodes
- **User Requirements:**
  - Nodes must stay attached to line endpoints
  - Entire structure moves as one organism
  - Animation speed reduced by half (24s)
  - Opacity set to 25%
- **Solution Implemented:**
  - Set `opacity: 0.25` on entire SVG
  - Animation duration: 24 seconds (half original speed)
  - Gentle vertical breathing motion (±3px translateY)
  - Transform: `translateX(-50%) translateY(Ypx)` maintains centering
  - Only rings pulse independently (8s cycle)
  - All nodes and connection lines move together as unified organism
  - Perfect connection integrity maintained at all times

**Final CSS Implementation:**
```css
.brand-separator svg {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1920px;
  height: 120px;
  pointer-events: none;
  z-index: 1;
  opacity: 0.25;
  animation: floatOrganism 24s ease-in-out infinite;
}

@keyframes floatOrganism {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(0); }
  25% { transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-3px); }
  50% { transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(2px); }
  75% { transform: translateX(-50%) translateY(-2px); }
}

@keyframes pulseRing {
  0%, 100% {
    transform: scale(1);
    opacity: 0.15;
  }
  50% {
    transform: scale(1.2);
    opacity: 0;
  }
}
```
