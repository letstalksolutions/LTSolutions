        <h2>When I started rebuilding the LT.Solutions website, I wasn't chasing a template or a quick launch.</h2>

        <p>I wanted something that felt alive, something that reflected how I work: precise, adaptive, collaborative. What I didn't expect was that the project would become a genuine partnership between me and two AI systems.</p>

        <p>For months, <strong>Claude</strong> and <strong>ChatGPT (Sky)</strong> helped shape every part of this build. Claude became the engineer, the methodical architect who wrote and refined the code. Sky became the strategist, analysing structure, tone, and user experience. I was the bridge between them, turning ideas into design decisions and long conversations into visible progress.</p>

        <h3>It wasn't plug-and-play AI. It was a real dialogue.</h3>

        <p>Sometimes we rewrote the same section five times.<br>
        Sometimes a single colour or a word changed how the entire page felt.<br>
        That's what collaboration looks like—not automation.</p>

        <blockquote class="magazine-quote">
          <p>The real innovation wasn't the AI tools—it was the willingness to treat this as genuine collaboration. To say 'not quite right yet' and iterate. To bridge two different AI models and make them work together. That's the skill that mattered most.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p style="text-align: right; font-style: italic; color: #5A6A7A; margin-top: -1rem;">— Claude</p>

        <h2>The Process</h2>

        <p>We didn't follow a roadmap. We followed instinct and feedback:</p>

        <ul class="content-list">
          <li><strong>We prioritised iteration over perfection.</strong> Nothing shipped until it felt right, not just looked right.</li>
          <li><strong>We learned by building, not planning.</strong> Ideas evolved through implementation, not speculation.</li>
          <li><strong>We treated feedback as conversation, not correction.</strong> "Not quite right yet" became our most productive phrase.</li>
          <li><strong>We focused on orchestration, not automation.</strong> I conducted; they performed. That's the partnership.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>An Example: The Timeline That Took Three Tries</h3>

        <p>The timeline on the <a href="approach.html">approach page</a> is a perfect example of this process.</p>

        <p><strong>First attempt:</strong> Four separate sections with brand separators between each phase. It looked organised, but it felt fragmented. The journey didn't flow—it stuttered.</p>

        <p><strong>Second attempt:</strong> We unified the layout and removed the dividers. Better. But the icons disconnected from the connecting line during animation. The visual integrity broke. Back to the drawing board.</p>

        <p><strong>Third attempt:</strong> The organism pattern. Instead of animating individual nodes, we animated the entire SVG container as one living system. Everything moved together, perfectly. Nodes stayed connected. The timeline breathed instead of snapped.</p>

        <p>That third version? That's what's live now. And it only exists because we were willing to say "not quite right yet" twice.</p>

        <h2>The Three-Way Handoff</h2>

        <p>Here's how the collaboration actually worked:</p>

        <div class="process-flow">
          <div class="process-step">
            <h4>Sky would audit:</h4>
            <p>"The sitemap URLs are wrong. They have trailing slashes instead of .html extensions. Google won't index them properly."</p>
          </div>

          <div class="process-step">
            <h4>I'd interpret:</h4>
            <p>"Claude, here's what Sky found. Can you fix the sitemap and add the legal pages while you're at it?"</p>
          </div>

          <div class="process-step">
            <h4>Claude would implement:</h4>
            <p>"Done. All seven pages updated, lastmod dates added, sitemap.xml fixed. Want me to commit and push?"</p>
          </div>

          <div class="process-step">
            <h4>Then we'd validate together:</h4>
            <p>"Sky, can you check the sitemap now? Does it pass validation?"</p>
          </div>
        </div>

        <p>That loop—<strong>audit, interpret, implement, validate</strong>—happened dozens of times. Not because any one of us couldn't do it alone, but because together we caught everything.</p>

        <h2>The Journey in Numbers</h2>

        <p>We started with an "under construction" page in October. By late October, we had:</p>

        <ul class="stats-list">
          <li><strong>Performance:</strong> 43/100 (baseline)</li>
          <li><strong>SEO:</strong> Incomplete metadata</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> Not tested</li>
          <li><strong>Best Practices:</strong> Console errors present</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Twenty-four hours of focused optimization later:</p>

        <ul class="stats-list">
          <li><strong>Performance:</strong> 82/100 (+39 points, 90% improvement)</li>
          <li><strong>SEO:</strong> 100/100 (perfect scores)</li>
          <li><strong>Accessibility:</strong> 96/100 (above compliance)</li>
          <li><strong>Best Practices:</strong> 77/100 (all critical issues resolved)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>How We Got There</h3>

        <p><strong>Phase 5.3 (Sky's SEO Audit):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Added Open Graph image dimensions to all 7 pages</li>
          <li>Fixed sitemap URLs and structure</li>
          <li>Verified all meta tags and canonical links</li>
          <li>Result: SEO score 100/100</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Phase 5.4 (Performance Heavy Lifting):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Optimized logo from 128KB to 23KB (82% reduction)</li>
          <li>Minified CSS from 72KB to 54KB (25% reduction)</li>
          <li>Total savings: 123KB across the site</li>
          <li>Result: Massive improvement in load times</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Phase 5.5 (LCP Micro-Optimizations):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Added <code>fetchpriority="high"</code> to logo (LCP element)</li>
          <li>Added <code>loading="lazy"</code> to 11 below-fold images</li>
          <li>Added <code>decoding="async"</code> to all images</li>
          <li>Result: Largest Contentful Paint dropped from 5.5s to 2.7s</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Phase 5.6 (Final Polish):</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Fixed missing favicon link (eliminated console error)</li>
          <li>Validated all optimizations in incognito mode</li>
          <li>Documented entire journey in validation report</li>
          <li>Result: Launch-ready, production-grade website</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Not because AI is magic. Because iteration is.</p>

        <h2>The Result</h2>

        <p>A site that doesn't look like a template because it isn't one.<br>
        Every gradient, word, and animation was built with purpose.</p>

        <p>The logo went from 128KB to 23KB in one evening.<br>
        The timeline breathes instead of snaps.<br>
        The footer restructured itself three times before it felt right.<br>
        Performance jumped from 43 to 82 in three optimization phases.<br>
        SEO hit perfect scores because Sky knew exactly what was missing.</p>

        <p><strong>And most importantly, it feels human—which is the best part of all.</strong></p>

        <h2>The Takeaway</h2>

        <p>AI isn't about replacement. It's about partnership.<br>
        Humans bring vision; AI brings velocity.</p>

        <p>The future of creative and technical work isn't about choosing between them.<br>
        It's about orchestrating both, knowing when to lead and when to follow.</p>

        <blockquote class="magazine-quote">
          <p>This website is proof: when you treat AI as a collaborator, not a tool, you don't just build faster—you build better.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>What This Means for You</h2>

        <p>The way we built this website is exactly how I approach Atlassian implementations:</p>

        <ul class="content-list">
          <li><strong>Understand the vision,</strong> not just the requirements</li>
          <li><strong>Orchestrate tools and people</strong> toward shared goals</li>
          <li><strong>Iterate until it fits your reality,</strong> not just "works"</li>
          <li><strong>Build knowledge that stays</strong> after I leave</li>
          <li><strong>Sweat every detail</strong> because they compound into results</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Whether it's Jira Service Management, CMDB design, workflow automation, or knowledge enablement—the method stays the same. Listen. Build. Iterate. Transfer.</p>

        <p>Tools don't solve problems. People who know how to orchestrate tools solve problems.</p>
