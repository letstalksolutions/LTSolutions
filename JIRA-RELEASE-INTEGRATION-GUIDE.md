2. Bulk update Fix Version to: `1.0.1`
3. Set Status to: `Done`

## ü§ñ Method 2: Automated Update via Jira API

If you want to automate this process, use the Jira REST API.

### Prerequisites
- Jira API Token (generate at: https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
- Jira email address
- Project key: `LS`

### Script: Create Versions and Update Tickets

Save this as `update-jira-releases.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Configuration
JIRA_URL="https://letstalksolutions.atlassian.net"
JIRA_EMAIL="your-email@example.com"
JIRA_API_TOKEN="your-jira-api-token-here"
PROJECT_KEY="LS"

# Step 1: Create Version 1.0.0
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "1.0.0",
    "description": "Production Launch - First stable release\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/letstalksolutions/LTSolutions/releases/tag/v1.0.0",
    "startDate": "2025-10-24",
    "releaseDate": "2025-10-26",
    "released": true,
    "project": "LS"
  }' \
  "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/3/version"

# Step 2: Create Version 1.0.1
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "1.0.1",
    "description": "Post-Production Refinements\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/letstalksolutions/LTSolutions/releases/tag/v1.0.1",
    "startDate": "2025-10-27",
    "releaseDate": "2025-10-27",
    "released": true,
    "project": "LS"
  }' \
  "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/3/version"

# Step 3: Create Version 1.1.0
curl -X POST \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "name": "1.1.0",
    "description": "Visual Consistency & Polish\n\nGitHub: https://github.com/letstalksolutions/LTSolutions/releases/tag/v1.1.0",
    "startDate": "2025-10-27",
    "releaseDate": "2025-10-28",
    "released": true,
    "project": "LS"
  }' \
  "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/3/version"

# Step 4: Update tickets for v1.0.0
for ticket in LS-103 LS-105 LS-106 LS-107 LS-108 LS-109 LS-110 LS-111 LS-112 LS-113 LS-114 LS-118 LS-119 LS-120 LS-123; do
  echo "Updating $ticket to version 1.0.0..."
  curl -X PUT \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" \
    -d '{
      "fields": {
        "fixVersions": [{"name": "1.0.0"}]
      }
    }' \
    "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/3/issue/$ticket"
done

# Step 5: Update tickets for v1.0.1
for ticket in LS-125 LS-127 LS-128 LS-129; do
  echo "Updating $ticket to version 1.0.1..."
  curl -X PUT \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" \
    -d '{
      "fields": {
        "fixVersions": [{"name": "1.0.1"}]
      }
    }' \
    "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/3/issue/$ticket"
done

# Step 6: Update tickets for v1.1.0
for ticket in LS-130 LS-131 LS-132 LS-133 LS-133a LS-134 LS-135 LS-136 LS-136a LS-137; do
  echo "Updating $ticket to version 1.1.0..."
  curl -X PUT \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -u "$JIRA_EMAIL:$JIRA_API_TOKEN" \
    -d '{
      "fields": {
        "fixVersions": [{"name": "1.1.0"}]
      }
    }' \
    "$JIRA_URL/rest/api/3/issue/$ticket"
done

echo "‚úÖ All tickets updated with fix versions!"
```

### To run the script:
```bash
chmod +x update-jira-releases.sh
./update-jira-releases.sh
```

## üîó Method 3: GitHub-Jira Smart Commits (Retrospective)

For future commits, you can use Smart Commits syntax:

```bash
git commit -m "LS-123 #done #comment Fixed the bug #fix-version 1.0.0"
```

This automatically:
- Transitions ticket to Done
- Adds a comment
- Sets fix version

**Note:** This only works for future commits, not retroactively.

---

## üìä Method 4: Release Hub Integration

If your Jira has the GitHub integration enabled:

1. Go to Jira Project Settings
2. Click **Integrations** ‚Üí **GitHub**
3. Link your GitHub repository
4. Releases will automatically appear in Jira Release Hub

---

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

After updating Jira:

- [ ] All 3 versions created in Jira (1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0)
- [ ] Each version has release date set
- [ ] Each version description includes GitHub release link
- [ ] All tickets have correct Fix Version assigned
- [ ] All tickets marked as Done/Released
- [ ] Release Hub shows deployment information (if integration enabled)

---

## üìà Release Board View

Create a "Releases" board filter in Jira:

```jql
project = LS AND fixVersion in (1.0.0, 1.0.1, 1.1.0) ORDER BY fixVersion DESC, key ASC
```

This gives you a complete view of all released work.

---

## üéØ Best Practices Going Forward

### For Each New Release:

1. **During Development:**
   - Add Fix Version to tickets as you create them
   - Use consistent version naming (SemVer)

2. **Before Release:**
   - Verify all tickets have Fix Version set
   - Create release in Jira with target date

3. **After GitHub Release:**
   - Update Jira version with GitHub release URL
   - Mark version as "Released"
   - Generate release notes in Jira

4. **Communication:**
   - Share Jira release notes with stakeholders
   - Link to GitHub release for technical details

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Issue: Can't find "Releases" in Jira
**Solution:** Look for "Versions" instead. In some Jira configurations, releases are called "versions".

### Issue: API returns 403 Forbidden
**Solution:**
- Verify API token is still valid
- Check you have "Administer Projects" permission
- Ensure you're using your email, not username

### Issue: Tickets don't show Fix Version field
**Solution:**
- Go to Project Settings ‚Üí Issue Types
- Edit the issue type (e.g., Story, Task)
- Add "Fix Version/s" field to the screen
